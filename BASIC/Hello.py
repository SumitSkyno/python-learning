print ("Hello Wolrd!")


#Text in Python must be inside quotes. You can use either " double quotes or ' single quotes
print('Single quotes statement')


#you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter: with comma in between 
print ("Same line: ", end="")
print ("This will print in same line")


#However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:
print(3)
print(777)
print(5.25)


#You can also do math inside print() function in case of numeric value 
print (5 + 5)
print (5 * 5)


#You can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma
print("My phone number", 9876543210,"is this.")
